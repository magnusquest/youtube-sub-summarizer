## Description
Modify the AI summarization prompt to focus on restating the transcript content in a more concise way, rather than describing or interpreting the video.

## Current Behavior
The prompt asks the AI to:
- Capture the main topic and key insights
- Highlight actionable takeaways or important points
- Write in a clear, engaging style suitable for email
- Avoid unnecessary details while maintaining accuracy

This results in summaries that **describe** the video rather than **restate** what was actually said.

## Desired Behavior
The prompt should instruct the AI to:
- Restate everything said in the transcript in a more concise form
- Preserve the actual content and points made in the video
- Condense redundancy and verbosity while keeping all key information
- Maintain the speaker's actual points rather than interpreting them

## Implementation Plan

### Task 1: Update Prompt in `summarize_transcript` Function
**File:** [src/summarizer.py](src/summarizer.py#L67-L81)

Replace the current prompt (lines 67-81) with a new prompt that:
- Instructs the AI to restate the transcript content concisely
- Emphasizes preserving actual points made rather than interpretation
- Removes guidance about 'actionable takeaways' and 'engaging style'
- Focuses on condensing redundancy while maintaining completeness

Example new prompt structure:
```
Please restate everything discussed in this transcript in a more concise form:
1. Preserve all key points and information from the original
2. Condense redundancy, repetition, and unnecessary verbosity
3. Maintain the speaker's actual points and perspective
4. Present as a concise summary (3-5 sentences) without adding interpretation
```

### Task 2: Update Tests
**File:** [tests/test_summarizer.py](tests/test_summarizer.py)

- Review existing tests for `summarize_transcript`
- Update test expectations to align with new 'restatement' approach
- Ensure tests verify that summaries preserve content rather than interpret it

### Task 3: Update Documentation
**Files:**
- [src/summarizer.py](src/summarizer.py#L50-L54) - Update docstring for `summarize_transcript`
- [src/summarizer.py](src/summarizer.py#L1-L11) - Update module docstring if needed

Update documentation to reflect:
- New summarization approach (restatement vs. interpretation)
- Changed expected output format

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Prompt updated to focus on restating rather than interpreting
- [ ] Tests pass and verify new behavior
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect changes
- [ ] Sample summaries demonstrate preservation of actual content
